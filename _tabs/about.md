## Who am I?

My name is George and I am a 19 Year Old student at Breda University of Applied Sciences, currently in Year 2. I study Game Programming and I specialize in Graphics Programming. I love a wide range of Video Games, Star Wars and Graphics!

## What is this blog about?

Here, I will be posting articles about projects I've worked on in the past and any interesting findings and techniques I've come across, related to the Graphics Sphere of course. I am a newbie when it comes to blog post writing so any feedback is greatly appreciated! Feel free to reach out to me on my socials, found in the bottom left corner of the Side Menu :)
